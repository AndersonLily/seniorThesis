# Bug specifiction document
## Introduction 
### Purpose 
This document's purpose is to define the bug that I want to incorportate in to the final project as types and variations that the project will handle and insert into a program. 

NOTE these bugs are aimed at a C++/C program and if other languages the types of bugs or the definitons might change.

These are also bugs as I understand them if I have misconceptions of misdefinitions I am 100% okay with correcting it.

## Bug Types

### Preprocessor bugs
These are bugs that affect what the preprocessor is doing or prevent it from doing what it should.
>Examples: Messing with #include, removing #pragma once from .h, adding #defines or removing #defines, creating conditionals if #if #endif

### Syntax errors
These are bugs that are very common problems that are to do with how the language is written.
>Examples: Misspelling established varaiables, removing or adding extra semicolons, or Spaces in function names.

### Functional errors
These are bugs that will either prevent the program from running, an error in logic, will prevent the project from it's intended use, or very inefficent.
>Examples: Memory leaks, redefinions od varaibles, erasing varaible declarations, buffer overflows, unused variables, Altering or creating loops to be infinite, messing with if statments, or making blocks impossilbe to enter.
