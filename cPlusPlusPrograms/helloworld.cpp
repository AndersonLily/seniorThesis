This program is often a programmers first running program in any langauge they are trying to learn.
If you are curious about it's orgins here's the wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program
Many IDE's also have this version or another prepopulated when you start a new project so get used to seeing it.
Even though it is "simple" code lots could go wrong with it, try running Spider on it!
