# Software Requirement Specification
## Introduction 
### Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to serve as a guide to designers, developers, and testers who are responsible for the engineering of the `Working title` project. It should give the engineers all of the information necessary to design, develop, and test the software.

### Scope
This document contains a complete description of the functionality of the `Working title` project. It consists of use cases, functional requirements, and non-functional requirements,
which, taken together, form a complete description of the software.

### System Overview 
This document is a complete description of the software application `Working title`. All relevant requirement information regarding the project is included in this document. `Working title` is intended for real-world programming students to train them how to identify common areas for bugs and what they look like. This application will be a VsCode extention able to add bugs into a runnable program that will either stop the program from able to be compile or allow compliation but have bugs considered "bad practice".

### Definitions 


## Use Cases

|Name| UC-1: File-Specification/Exemption |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Summary | A user will be able to select which files this extention will "bug" and which ones it will not.|
| Rational | When programming the user may want to use the extention on select files but leave others alone because they don't want to change them. File specification and Exemption will allow a user to decide. |
| Users | All users|
| Preconditons | A user will have written or load a "runnable" program into VsCode. The user will also have the extention open|
| Basic Events  | <ol><li>A user will select to bug their program.</li><li>Then the user will be asked if they want to bug all their files.</li><li>The user indicates no.</li><li>The program responds by allowing a user to select or exempt which files to bug.</li><li>The user will indicate what files they want bugs.</li><li>The program will continue.</li></ol> |
| Alternative Paths| <ol><li>A user will select to bug their program</li><li>Then the user will be asked if they want to bug all their files.</li><li>The user indicates yes.</li><li>The program will continue.</li></ol> |
| Post Conditions | As the program continutes it will only alter files that the user indicates. The program will NOT alter files that the user didn't specify.|
