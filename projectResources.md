## Introduction

### VS CODE 
**[Extention API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api)**
This link is VS Code's official website and explains of how to use their API.

**[Extention guide](https://dev.to/raxcodes/how-to-create-your-own-vs-code-extension-a-simple-step-by-step-guide-94)**
This link is a step-by-step guide by DEV about how to create a VS code extension, it seems to primarily focus on how to implement it in C#

**[VS code icons](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/icons-in-labels#icon-listing)** A list of the current vs code icons and their purposes; I think reusing one of these will be my choice if I extend the sidebar menu so I do not have to get the icon approved by the VS code style guidelines.
